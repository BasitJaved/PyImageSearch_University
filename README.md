# PyImageSearch_University

This repository will contain the work I reproduce during I learn Computer Vision from Pyimagesearch University, All lesson learned will be mentioned below.

# 1- OpenCV 101 - OpenCV Basics
    a) Read an Image, check it's shape, display an image and Save image into a new file
    b) Getting and Setting Pixels
    c) Drawing with OpenCV (Basic drawing, drawing on pictures)
    d) Image Translation (moving image left, right, up and down)
    e) Image Rotation (Rotating Image arround an axis)
    f) Image Resize (Resizing image keeping the original aspect ratio of image)
    g) Image Flipping (Flipping Image horizontally and Vertically)
    h) Image Cropping (Cropping ROI from image)
    i) Image Arithmetic (Using Arithmetic operations on images)
    j) Bitwise Operations (and, or, xor, not)
    k) Masking

# 2- OpenCV 102 - OpenCV Basic Image Processing Operations
    a) Morphological Operations
    b) Smoothing and Blurring (Average, Gaussian, Median and Bilateral Blur)
    c) Color Spaces
    d) Basic Thresholding
    e) Adaptive Thresholding
    f) Convolutions
    g) Image Gradients
    h) Edge Detection
    i) Automatic Edge Detection

# 3- OpenCV 104 - Histograms
    a) Image Histograms
    b) Histogram and Adaptive Histogram Equalization
    c) Histogram Matching
    d) Gamma Correction
    e) Automatic Color Correction
    f) Detecting Low Contrast Images
 
# 4- Augmented Reality 101 â€” Fiducials and Markers
    a) AprilTag Detection
    b) Generating ArUCo Markers with OpenCV
    c) Detecting ArUCo Markers with OpenCV
    d) Automatically Determining ArUCo Marker Type
    e) Augmented Reality with ArUco Markers
    f) Augmented Reality with ArUco Markers
